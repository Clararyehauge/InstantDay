      <h2>WHAT IS INSTANT DAY?</h2>
      <p>Instant Day isn&#39;t really a photo competition, it&#39;s more a homage to good old analogue, instant photography - everybody who participates are winners. But we do have a nice prize for one lucky instant photographer!</p>

    <h2>WHY INSTANT PHOTOGRAPHY?</h2>
    <p>Instant Photography is a testament to life: It all started back in the 1940&#39;s with a 3 year old kid.</p>

    <div>
      <p>She wanted to see her fathers images right away. The father, Edwin Land, embarked on a mission: To invent instant photography.</p>

      <p>
        Half a decade later, Edwin Land launched Instant photography and established the Polaroid brand. Instant photography turned into big business in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s, until the digital era almost killed the industry. However, the massive
        amount of time wasted on the small screens have spurred a counterreaction: Analogue, off-line experiences have become popular again.

    </div>
    <p>And instant photography is just that: An analogue, life-affirming and tactile photography experience. So let&#39;s celebrate life, and make memories.</p>
