    <p class="font-instrument-sans text-bg2-500 text-base/7 lg:text-[18px] lg:text-center lg:col-start-1 lg:col-span-12">Instant Photography is a testament to life: It all started back in the 1940&#39;s with a 3 year old kid.</p>

    <div class="lg:col-start-2 lg:col-span-5 lg:mt-15">
      <p class="font-instrument-sans text-bg2-500 text-base/7 lg:text-[18px]">She wanted to see her fathers images right away. The father, Edwin Land, embarked on a mission: To invent instant photography.</p>

      <!-- <img src="" alt="" /> -->
      <p class="mb-6 font-instrument-sans text-bg2-500 text-base/7 lg:text-[18px]">Half a decade later, Edwin Land launched Instant photography and established the Polaroid brand. Instant photography turned into big business in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s, until the digital era almost killed the industry.</p>
      <p class="font-instrument-sans text-bg2-500 text-base/7 lg:text-[18px]">However, the massive amount of time wasted on the small screens have spurred a counterreaction: Analogue, off-line experiences have become popular again.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="font-instrument-sans text-bg2-500 text-base/7 lg:text-[18px] lg:col-start-2 lg:col-span-5">And instant photography is just that: An analogue, life-affirming and tactile photography experience. So let&#39;s celebrate life, and make memories.</p>

          <h2 class="font-notable text-2xl mb-2">Terms & conditions</h2>
          <p>By participating in the contest, you accept the following terms and conditions</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="font-notable text-2xl mb-2">Participation</h2>
          <p>The competition is open to all photographers, both amateurs and professionals, who are over 18 years old.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="font-notable text-2xl mb-2">Instant Photo</h2>
          <p>Every submission has to be an analogue instant photo - not a digital montage made in a photo editing suite. The instant can be made in various ways, with analogue instant cameras, digital instant cameras like ie. the Fujifilm EVO or scan-and-print tools like ie. the Polaroid Lab. The instant photo can be manipulated with analogue processes - the organizers encourage instant photography experiments. The submission can depict the instant photo in many ways: As a flat scan without or without the instant photo frame, as a photo showing the instants in a frame, on the wall etc. The instant doesnâ€™t need to be just one photo: It can be a panorama or collage of multiple instants that make up one submission.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="font-notable text-2xl mb-2">Consent</h2>

Participants release the organizers from any claim, lawsuit or liability related to their participation in the competition.</p>
