    <img src="" alt="" />
    <p>Instant Day is a small project run by a couple of lecturers from the Multimedia Design programme at EK, Business Academy Copenhagen. Instant Day is a bi-annual project where lecturers and students collaborate on a digital design and communication project related to the Instant Day competition. In essence, we just want to promote instant photography and have fun while doing it. Cheers.</p>
